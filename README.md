# Solar-panel-damage-classification 

The Solar Panel Damage Detection project aims to enhance the monitoring and maintenance of large solar photovoltaic (PV) systems by leveraging computer vision techniques. The project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to classify different types of solar panel damage, including bird droppings, dust accumulation, electrical damage, physical damage, and snow coverage.

🌞 Key Objectives: Maximize solar PV system uptime Minimize maintenance costs

🗂️ Data Collection and Preprocessing: The dataset consists of images of defective and non-defective solar panels Data preprocessing steps include auto-orient, resizing, and grayscale conversion Data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, and blurring, are applied to enhance the dataset

🧠 Model Building and Comparison: Three YOLO models (YOLOv8, YOLOv7, and YOLOv5) are trained and compared for accuracy YOLOv8 achieves the best performance with a mean average precision (mAP50)

🚀 Model Deployment: A Streamlit application is developed to perform object detection using the trained YOLOv8 model The application allows users to upload images and detects solar panel damage in real-time

🌟 Future Scope: Real-time monitoring of solar panel arrays for early detection of issues Integration with data analytics for deriving insights on panel performance and maintenance patterns Optimization of energy production through improved decision-making based on object detection data The Solar Panel Damage Detection project showcases the potential of computer vision and deep learning techniques in enhancing the efficiency and reliability of solar energy systems. By automating the detection of solar panel damage, maintenance teams can prioritize repairs, minimize downtime, and optimize energy production, ultimately contributing to the growth of the renewable energy sector. 🌱
